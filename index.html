    <h2 style="text-align: center;">H Mart and Sunrise Market</h2>
    <p style="text-align: center;">Michelle often went to H Mart and Sunrise Market with her mother to go grocery shopping together. She describes shopping with her mom as one of the times they could bond together, and it made Michelle feel connected to her Korean culture. After her mother passed away, she had to learn how to navigate these markets, that were so familiar to her mother, by herself. Below, are ingredients she has seen and bought, and recipes she has made, in the book.</p>

            <img src="IMG_1447.PNG" alt="Chamoe" style="width: 400px; height: auto;">
            <div class="tooltip"> I fondle the produce and say the words aloud— <b>chamoe melon</b> , danmuji.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="IMG_1446.PNG" alt="Danmuji" style="width: 420px; height: auto;">
            <div class="tooltip"><b>Danmuji</b> - Pickled daikon radish, often eaten as a sidedish with jjangmyeon. </div>
        </div>

        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="IMG_1450.PNG" alt="Cream Soup" style="width: 400px; height: auto;">
            <div class="tooltip">The only thing she (mom) could come up with was Ottogi brand cream soup, an instant powder I could buy at the Asian grocery that was neutral and easy to digest. “Keu-reem seu-peu,” I whispered. <b>Cream soup</b>.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="IMG_1448.PNG" alt="Soondubu Jjigae" style="width: 400px; height: auto;">
            <div class="tooltip" style="width: 1000px;">Another is for traditional Korean <b>jjigaes</b>, bubbling soups served in traditional earthenware pots called ttukbaegis, which act as mini cauldrons to ensure that your soup is still bubbling a good ten minutes past arrival. <br><br> I racked my brain for something I could make them for breakfast and
                landed on doenjang jjigae, the ultimate Korean comfort food. My mother
                often served it alongside our Korean meals, a rich, hearty stew filled with
                vegetables and tofu. I had never made the dish myself, but I knew its basic
                components and what it should taste like. Still in bed, I turned onto my side
                and googled how to make Korean fermented soybean soup.</div>

            <img src="IMG_1449.PNG" alt="Ssam Galbi" style="width: 400px; height: auto;">
            <div class="tooltip" style="width: 1000px;">Julia, the golden retriever we’d had since I was twelve, fell onto her back, paws up, submitting her giant stomach in a pose my mother always referred to as “breasts up!” while my mother grilled the <b>galbi</b> I would always associate with the taste of home. <br><br> She (LA Kim) went through the kitchen cabinets, filling garbage bags with the expired cans my mother had accumulated in the pantries, and volunteered to prepare the galbi, my favorite celebratory Korean dish, for our wedding. Once, when I was in college, my mother walked me through her recipe over the phone. She relayed the ingredients haphazardly, rattling off the brand of mulyeot, or sweet barley malt syrup, and describing the tin of sesame oil she had at home as I darted around H Mart, struggling to keep up. Back at home, I called again to have her walk me through the process, frustrated that her instructions were always so convoluted, even when it came to making rice.</div>

            <div class="tooltip">The food court is the perfect place to people-watch while sucking down salty, fatty <b>jjajangmyeon</b>. I think about my family who lived in Korea, before most of them died, and how Korean-Chinese was always the first thing we’d eat when my mom and I arrived in Seoul after a fourteen-hour flight from America. </div>

    <div class="quotes" id="quotes">
        <h2 style="text-align: center;">My favorite quotes from the book!</h2>
        <p>
            “Hers was tougher than tough love. It was brutal, industrial-strength. A sinewy love that never gave way to an inch of weakness. It was a love that saw what was best for you ten steps ahead, and didn't care if it hurt like hell in the meantime. When I got hurt, she felt it so deeply, it was as though it were her own affliction. She was guilty only of caring too much. I realize this now, only in retrospect. No one in this world would ever love me as much as my mother, and she would never let me forget it.”
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <p>
            “I had an abortion after you because you were such a terrible child! …I was just shocked she had witheld something so monumental. I envied and feared my mothers ability to keep matters private. A rare talent for keeping secrets, even from us. She did not need anyone. She could surprise you with how little she needed you. All those years she instructed me to save 10 percent of myself like she did, I never knew it meant she had also been keeping a part of herself from me too.” (66)
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <p>
            “This coud be my chance, I thought, to make ammends for everything. For all the burdens I’d imposed as a hyperactive child, for all the vitriol I’d spewed as a tortured teen… I would radiate joy and positivity and it would cure her. I would wear whatever she wanted, complete every chore without protest, I would learn to cook for her—all the things she loved to eat, and I would singlehandedly keep her from withering away. I would repay her fora ll the debts Id accrued. I would be everything she ever needed. I would make her sorry for ever not wanting me to be there. I would be the perfect daughter.” (67)
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <p>
            “I wanted to cry with her, at this image I too did not recognize, this giant physical manifestation of evil that had entered our lives. But instead I felt my body stiffen, my heart harden, my feelings freeze over. An internal voice commanded ‘Do not break down. If you cry, it’s acknowleding danger. If you cry, she will not stop.’” (91)
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <p>
            “There was no one in the world that was ever as critical or could make me feel as hideous as my mother, but there was no one, not even Peter, who ever made me feel as beautiful. Deep down I always believed her. That no one would tell me the truth if my hair looked sloppy or if my makeup was overdone.” (141)
